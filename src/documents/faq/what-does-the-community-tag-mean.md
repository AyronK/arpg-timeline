title: What does the "COMMUNITY" tag mean?
content: The "COMMUNITY" tag indicates that a game or cycle is not officially
  recognized or supported by its original publishers. This means it is created
  by fans or third parties without the endorsement or active support of the
  official game developers or publishers. As a result, the original publishers
  do not provide support for "COMMUNITY" content, and any issues or questions
  should be directed to the creators or the community that developed it.
