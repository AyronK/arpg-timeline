title: Am I the product? Does the website have a hidden cost?
content: "**Absolutely not!** This website will always remain free of charge,
  without ads or monetization. My only support comes from your donations and
  kind words, which I truly appreciate. I prioritize your privacy and providing
  high-quality free content, and as long as I can manage it myself, I will
  continue to do so. If I ever request money, it will be for optional features
  that may incur infrastructure costs, such as Discord notifications or
  newsletters. These features will not affect the current website experience and
  incoming incremental updates to build the best season tracker that will ever
  exist!"
