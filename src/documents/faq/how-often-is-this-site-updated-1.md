content: We monitor a range of channels, including official websites, wikis,
  Reddit threads, Steam news, and other carefully selected sources. Moderators
  are notified on Discord of anything relevant to current or upcoming seasons.
  To streamline the process, notifications are first reviewed by an AI model,
  reducing manual effort. However, **a human always performs the final
  verification**.
